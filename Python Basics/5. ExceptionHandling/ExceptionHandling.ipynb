    "Code Breakdown:\n",
    "1. Custom Exception\n",
    "A custom exception CustomError is created using Python's built-in Exception class. Custom exceptions are helpful when you want to define errors specific to your application logic.\n",
    "2. try Block\n",
    "The code inside the try block is executed first. If no exception is raised, the rest of the code (inside the else block) is executed.\n",
    "In the divide_numbers function, we try to divide two numbers, which might raise exceptions like ZeroDivisionError or TypeError.\n",
    "3. except Block\n",
    "The except block catches specific exceptions that are raised in the try block.\n",
    "In our example, we handle:\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError when the denominator is zero.\n",
    "TypeError if the input types are incorrect (e.g., dividing a number by a string).\n",
    "If the exception matches, the corresponding block is executed.\n",
    "4. else Block\n",
    "The else block runs only if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n",
    "In our example, if the division succeeds without any issues, it prints \"Division successful!\" and returns the result.\n",
    "5. finally Block\n",
    "The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "It is typically used for cleanup operations, like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "In our example, it prints \"Execution complete.\" after each division attempt."

    "Key Points to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Handling Multiple Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can catch multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks, as shown in the example above. You can also catch multiple exceptions in one except block using parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "except (ZeroDivisionError, TypeError) as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using else:\n",
    "\n",
    "The else block runs only if no exceptions occur in the try block. This can be useful for code that should run only when no error has occurred.\n",
    "Using finally:\n",
    "\n",
    "The finally block runs no matter what. It is useful for cleanup tasks such as closing files, releasing resources, or other final actions that must always be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Raising Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can raise your own exceptions using the raise keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "raise CustomError(\"This is a custom exception\")\n",
    "Nested Try-Except Blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can nest try-except blocks to handle different types of errors at different levels of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Additional Resources for Exception Handling:\n",
    "Python Docs on Exceptions: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html\n",
    "Real Python on Exception Handling: https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/\n",
    "By understanding these core concepts of exception handling, you will be well-prepared for handling errors effectively in your Python programs! You can now copy and paste this code into VS Code and start experimenting with different exceptions and scenarios."
